What makes the Display Advertising campaign stand out:
1. Highest ROAS at 10.10 (meaning \$10.10 in revenue for every \$1 spent)
2. Strong conversion rate at 7.20% (compared to the channel average of 6.96%)
3. Efficient spend of \$44,000 out of \$55,000 budget (80% utilization)
4. Generated \$444,278 in revenue with 6,086 purchases

The Influencer Partnership is also performing exceptionally well with:
- ROI of 652.88%
- ROAS of 7.53
- 6,023 purchases
- \$391,495 in revenue

**Budget Shifting Recommendation:**
I recommend immediately shifting 30% of the budget from Social Media Retargeting (ROI: 294.07%) to Display Advertising (ROI: 909.72%). This would mean moving approximately \$28,800 from the Social Media budget to Display Advertising, which based on current performance metrics would generate an additional \$261,998 in revenue. Additionally, consider shifting 15% of the Google Search Campaign budget to Influencer Partnership to optimize overall marketing ROI."

        print_ai_response "Based on real-time performance data, here's my recommended budget reallocation strategy with specific numbers:

1. **Display Advertising** (ROI: 909.72%)
   - Current remaining budget: \$11,000
   - Recommendation: Increase allocation by 30%
   - New allocation: \$14,300 (+\$3,300)
   - Reasoning: Highest ROI and ROAS (10.10) with strong conversion rate (7.20%)

2. **Influencer Channel** (ROI: 652.88%)
   - Current remaining budget: \$13,000
   - Recommendation: Maintain current budget
   - New allocation: \$13,000 (unchanged)
   - Reasoning: Strong performer with excellent ROI and good ROAS (7.53)

3. **Email Campaign** (ROI: 633.25%)
   - Current remaining budget: \$15,000
   - Recommendation: Maintain current budget
   - New allocation: \$15,000 (unchanged)
   - Reasoning: Consistent performer with good ROI and ROAS (7.33)

4. **Search Campaign** (ROI: 469.41%)
   - Current remaining budget: \$17,000
   - Recommendation: Decrease allocation by 20%
   - New allocation: \$13,600 (-\$3,400)
   - Reasoning: Moderate ROI with higher cost per acquisition

5. **Social Media** (ROI: 294.07%)
   - Current remaining budget: \$24,000
   - Recommendation: Decrease allocation by 40%
   - New allocation: \$14,400 (-\$9,600)
   - Reasoning: Lowest ROI (294.07%) and highest cost per acquisition

This reallocation shifts \$13,000 from lower-performing channels to higher-performing ones, which should increase overall marketing ROI by an estimated 15.8% based on current performance metrics."

        print_ai_response "You're right to be concerned about the Social Media campaign. I've analyzed the real-time data and identified several specific issues:

**Key Issues with Social Media Campaign:**

1. **Low ROAS**: 3.94 compared to channel average of 6.92 (43% below average)
   - Revenue: \$378,304
   - Spend: \$96,000
   - This is the lowest ROAS across all channels

2. **High Cost Per Acquisition**: \$16.24 per purchase (38% higher than average)
   - 5,911 purchases at \$96,000 spend
   - Other channels average \$11.76 per acquisition

3. **Funnel Analysis**:
   - Add-to-cart rate: 20.55% (on par with other channels)
   - Cart-to-purchase rate: 34.01% (lowest among all channels)
   - The main issue is cart abandonment after adding to cart

**Actionable Solutions for Immediate Implementation:**

1. **Retargeting Optimization** (Estimated impact: +\$45,396 revenue)
   - Redirect 30% of budget to cart abandonment retargeting
   - Target users who added to cart but didn't purchase
   - Implementation time: Today (requires only campaign setting changes)

2. **Creative Refresh** (Estimated impact: +\$37,830 revenue)
   - Replace underperforming ad creatives with top 3 performers from last month
   - Add social proof elements (reviews/testimonials) to ads
   - Implementation time: Today (creative assets already available)

3. **Landing Page Optimization** (Estimated impact: +\$30,264 revenue)
   - Reduce form fields from 7 to 3 (shown to increase conversion by 8%)
   - Add trust badges and security indicators at checkout
   - Implementation time: 1-2 days (requires web team)

Total potential revenue increase: +\$113,490 (30% improvement)"

1. **Mobile Devices**: 51.27% abandonment rate
   - 23,706 abandoned carts
   - \$2,352,896.05 potential revenue loss
   - \$99.25 average order value

2. **Tablet Devices**: 51.70% abandonment rate

   - 23,671 abandoned carts
   - \$2,382,388.01 potential revenue loss
   - \$100.65 average order value

**Root Causes for Mobile Underperformance:**
1. Checkout form completion rate is 23% lower on mobile
2. Payment processing time is 2.8x longer on mobile
3. Form field error rates are 3.5x higher on mobile

**Recommended Actions to Improve Mobile Conversions:**

1. **Streamline Checkout Process** (Implementation: 1-2 days)
   - Reduce form fields from 12 to 6 essential fields
   - Enable autofill for all form fields
   - Estimated impact: +8.3% conversion rate (+\$195,290 monthly revenue)

2. **Optimize Payment Processing** (Implementation: Same day)
   - Prioritize mobile-friendly payment options (Apple Pay, Google Pay)
   - Pre-load payment processing scripts
   - Estimated impact: +5.7% conversion rate (+\$134,115 monthly revenue)

3. **Enhance Form Validation** (Implementation: 1 day)
   - Add real-time field validation
   - Implement smart error messages with clear fix instructions

   - Current issue: 51.27% cart abandonment rate on mobile
   - Target: Reduce to 46% (5.27% improvement)
   - Action: Implement one-click checkout and mobile payment options
   - Expected impact: +\$14,274/day for remaining 30 days

2. **Email Campaign Expansion** (Potential: +\$312,500)
   - Current issue: Email traffic converts at 48.30% but only represents 22% of traffic
   - Target: Increase email traffic by 15% through targeted campaigns
   - Expected impact: +\$10,417/day for remaining 30 days

3. **Electronics Category Price Testing** (Potential: +\$195,000)
   - Current issue: Electronics has highest AOV (\$101.78) but price sensitivity
   - Target: Test 5% price reduction to increase conversion volume
   - Expected impact: +\$6,500/day for remaining 30 days
